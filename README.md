# Covid-19InfoApp
Android App project for Coursera Capstone. Provides updated Covid-19 data from webservice API disease.sh

## Introduction

### Course Info
Coursera Certificate "Android App Development" ends with a capstone project. It requires using at least one activity, one service, one broadcast receiver, one content provider, interact with at least one remotely hosted webservice over the network via HTTP, and at least 2 interface screens.

### App Basic Idea
This app will provide with a simple data tracker for the Covid-19 crisis. It will provide given data (i.e. confirmed, recovered, dead) for the world, certain countries and the state/provinces of certain countries. The user will be able to save one country/province they wish to see automatically.

At first, only the updated daily total and daily new cases will be provided for each, and this data can be saved to the phone to be view again. Ideally, the app will also provide all past total and new cases, which again can be saved to the phone. The next goal is to provide graphs to visual show trends of these data points.
